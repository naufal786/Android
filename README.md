Hello,

So i have been having a hectic week with work and family wedding and was trying to implement firebase on my journal app.
I did manage to implement firebase in which I can add entries for a specific user on it.
Also managed to include authentication from firebase.
I was having a few issues with viewing the data from firebase on my recycler view. Somehow it wasn’t doing the listener event to read the data.
Basically all I needed was a bit of time so I could finish this.
I did the course and finished it all on time, helped a few guys on ALC also, only thing was the timing of the 7days challenge just wasn’t right for me. 
Hope I do get the nano degree, after so much work to come to the end and not get it would be sad. I will however continue to learn from the other courses that audacity offers for android google developers which would be an awesome thing.

Best Regards, 
Naufal Amin
